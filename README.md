# My Productivity Workflow

I find it very difficult to find the right tools and methods that help the workflow to accomplish tasks and plan the day. So here is a collection of the tools I use as it may help someone.

## Tools

The most important tool is Todoist. I use it to capture all my thoughts. I can access Todoist from my laptop and phone in a maximum of three clicks. This means that every task and every thought goes straight into the Todoist inbox. This helps to clear my head quickly and ensures that nothing is forgotten. The free plan of Todoist is more than enough for that purpose.

Secondly I use Google Calendar to store all fixed appointments.

The next tool is GoodDay which is a work management platform, that is often used for collaboration in teams, but it is also perfect for individuals.
I use it to track all my tasks for work and university. GoodDay allows it to have a hierarchy of projects so you can build a very structured layout of all tasks.
I pay for the business version, which gives access to the 'Workflow' feature. This feature allows you to arrange tasks and see the amount of work for each day, which helps a lot during scheduling.

Talking about scheduling, I also have a daily planner als pocket book. It is helpful because you do not get distracted every time you look on your Todo app. I will talk about that in the section of rituals.

The last two tools are YouTrack and Clockify. I use the free version of both tools. YouTrack helps me organizing all my side projects and I use Clockify to track the time I am working on each project (because I love the numbers). 


# Rituals

Every morning (after coffee) I look through all my todos and prioritize them in my mind. I then schedule them in my paper planner. For me it is important that I schedule in the morning and not the evening before, because I want the freedom to order the tasks with respect to joy. If I don't want to start with the big task, that's okey, I schdeule it later. But it is important to mention that I already know what to do (all todos on the lists), but not the concrete order.

Every evening after my day, I start looking through my paper planner and check off all things I have done and add the time it took. It helps me having a overview how much I have done and I can see if I estimated the needed time correctly. This helps improving my scheduling skills. Speaking of them, I often have to reschedule things because my estimates are wrong or I have a bad day and am not that motivated and so on.

After that is done, I look at my Todoist inbox and handle EVERY entry. Inbox-Zero is the goal. If it is work then I add it to the appropriate project in GoodDay, if it is a event I add it to Google Calendar, if it is a personal todo I add it to a separate Todoist list, and so on.
